== Roadmap

* [ ] fix TODOs in lexer and parser grammars
* [ ] highlight Pkldoc
* [x] navigate to modules with `module:` uris (search on project class path)
* [x] navigate to modules with `http(s):` uris
* [x] complete module uris
* [x] complete keywords (context-sensitive)
* [x] complete methods and properties
* [x] documentation support (e.g., quick documentation popup)
* [x] collapse module doc comment by default (often very large)
* [x] go to class/symbol
* [ ] evaluate Pkl module via run configuration
* [ ] implement PSI stubs and stub indexing, improve Go To Class/Symbol
* additional highlighting/checking via annotator, e.g.:
** [ ] highlight annotations
** [ ] check multi-line string invariants (leading/trailing newline, valid indentation)
** [x] check validity of modifiers, flag duplicate modifiers
* navigate to/complete elements in
** [x] lexical scope
** [x] pkl.base
*** [x] take pkl.base module from IntelliJ module class path
** [x] imported modules (take stdlib modules from the same places as pkl.base)
** [x] amended/extended module (may not have `module.` qualifier when referenced from root scope)
* implement any other feature listed in the https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/custom_language_support.html[custom language support] guide
* [x] rename refactoring

== Setup

* Install {uri-jdk}[JDK 11]
* Install {uri-intellij}[IntelliJ IDEA]
** Install Grammar-Kit plugin
** To import the project into IntelliJ, go to File->Open and select the project's root directory.
If the project is opened but not imported, look for a popup in the lower right corner
and click its "Import Gradle Project" link.

== Build Commands

`./gradlew build` performs a full build.

`./gradlew runIde` starts a fresh IDE with the plugin installed.

== Debugging

To debug the plugin, go to the _runIde_ task in the Gradle window and debug it.

== Release

Before a release, run Code->Inspect Code->Whole Project (at least) for pkl-hub project and check the results.

The release CI build publishes the plugin zip and the `updatePlugins.xml`. +
The plugin update site is automatically updated.
